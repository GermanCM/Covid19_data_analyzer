## COVID-19 data evolution
___

### This is a Covid19 virus data monitor with 2 main goals: 
> - unifying some useful information from several data sources to get insights at a glance
> - trying to make as fair as possible comparisons between countries evolution, with the
    aim of getting some better understanding, and if possible learn some key factors  

*Keep in mind that these data is being collected with a high degree of urgency and surely with different criteria among countries, which could affect some conclusions drawn from it.*

It is important to know that the main goal of this app is to get some additional insights based on a fair comparison between countries, and not only based on raw numbers; that is the reason for the page showing normalized data, based on different criteria as:
- population data by country
- elderly ratio by country
- ...

And this is just a few examples of what you can see in the application.
New ideas and sharing knowledge is all welcome :)
